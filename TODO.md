## Environment Setup

To enable Discord webhook functionality, create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
VITE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_TESTIMONIAL=your_testimonial_webhook_url
VITE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_CONTACT=your_contact_webhook_url
```

To enable Supabase functionality, add these to your `.env` file:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

If webhook URLs are not configured, forms will still work and log data to the console instead of sending to Discord.

## Current Status

The website is now fully functional with:
- âœ… All pages working with proper navigation
- âœ… Complete form functionality with Discord integration
- âœ… Double submission prevention
- âœ… Responsive design and modern UI
- âœ… Modular, maintainable code structure
- âœ… Fixed React Router version conflicts
- âœ… Fixed environment variable naming for Vite compatibility
- âœ… Supabase integration for data persistence
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

The next major milestone is setting up the Supabase project and database to enable data persistence and management through the Supabase dashboard.
