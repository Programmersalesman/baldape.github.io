- ✅ **Restored simplified debugging components** - Added back FormDebugPanel with essential testing functions

## Environment Setup

To enable Discord webhook functionality, create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
VITE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_TESTIMONIAL=your_testimonial_webhook_url
VITE_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_CONTACT=your_contact_webhook_url
```

If webhook URLs are not configured, forms will still work and log data to the console instead of sending to Discord.

- ✅ Double submission prevention
- ✅ Responsive design and modern UI
- ✅ Modular, maintainable code structure
